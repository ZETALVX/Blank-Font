# Blank Font

A blank font I made with FontForge.

If used, all characters will be white.
Useful if you want to hide text on a white background.

Example: in Outlook, if you print an email, you cannot remove the username at the top left.
If we set this font with white characters as the font of that username text, it will not be visible.
